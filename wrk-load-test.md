## results under normal load
pm2 has double throughput rate with half latency and much less socket errors in most cases.
But with 4 cores in use on local machine. (worth cost on amazon?)

## results under high load
the timeouts happening are comparable in the given time segment of load, but the request/sec served by pm2 cluster is 2-3 times.
